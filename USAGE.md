Excpet for `createRStyle` and `useRStyle`, All methods within this package offer two usage options, a longer syntax for those who prefer explicitness, and an abbreviated version for those who prefer conciseness. Choose the approach that best suits your preferred import and usage style.

```js
import {
  useMediaQuery,
  responsiveScale,
  responsiveWidth,
  responsiveHeight,
  useResponsiveDim,
  useResponsiveScale,
  useResponsiveWidth,
  useResponsiveHeight,
  useResponsiveMethods,
  //HOC
  withMediaQuery,
  withResponsiveMethods,
} from 'react-native-full-responsive';
//or
import {
  rs,
  rw,
  rh,
  useRD,
  useRS,
  useRW,
  useRH,
  useRM,
  useMQ,
  //HOC
  withMQ,
  withRM,
} from 'react-native-full-responsive';
```

## Full Responsive Provider

To use the `responsiveScale` hook, first you should use `FRProvider` in the root component.

```tsx
import { FRProvider } from 'react-native-full-responsive';
//...

export default function App() {
  return (
    <FRProvider>
      {
        //...
      }
    </FRProvider>
  );
}
```

The provider accepts `bases` and `type` props; explanations of each follow.

<h3>type</h3>

Specifies the current device dimension type that size scaling calculations will use, based on specified related bases.

_Possible values_: `xs` | `sm` | `md` | `lg` | `xl` | `2xl`

_Default_: `sm`

_Determination_ (suggestion):

- Can be based on device specification type (e.g., "sm" for smartphones, "md" for tablets).
- Can be dynamically determined using the [useMediaQuery](<'#useMediaQuery-(useMQ)>) hook, based on device dimensions.

<h3>bases</h3>

_Description_: Specifies or overrides default experimental base sizes to achieve the ideal point for scaling for each dimension type.

_Default_:

```ts
{
  'xs' = 320,
  'sm' = 360,
  'md' = 520,
  'lg' = 680,
  'xl' = 740,
  '2xl' = 920,
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **_Note: While we'll explore the three main methods and their usage below, it's highly recommended to use the provided hooks (and HOCs for class components) for dynamic dimensions and a more streamlined approach._**

## createRStyle

This method is similar to `StyleSheet.create` and can be used in the same way. However, the key difference is that it allows you to easily create responsive styles by utilizing the following responsive patterns (inspired by [react-native-size-matters](https://github.com/nirsky/react-native-size-matters)):

`number(rs|rw|rh)`

These patterns accept a number (which can be a signed or unsigned integer or a float number) and a suffix to specify responsive methods.

This method accepts two arguments: the first argument is your style, and the second argument is optional. The second argument allows for more advanced and flexible usage.

```ts
createRStyle(styles, config);
```

The config options includes:

<h3>method</h3>

_Possible values_: `recursive` | `linear`

_Default_: `recursive`

To specify the parsing styles method, in this case, the recursive method is generally faster than the linear method (although the algorithm is not strictly linear, it has the potential for linear time complexity and is called linear). However, for deep and large structured objects, the linear algorithm may be more appropriate.

<h3>width</h3>

To use custom dimensions width for the calculation

<h3>height</h3>

To use custom dimensions height for the calculation

<h3>scaleConfig</h3>

To use a specific responsive scale method config for applying when using `rs` for style properties

```ts
const styles = createRStyle({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  box: {
    width: '20rw',
    height: '10rh',
    marginVertical: `5rs`,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: 'yellow',
    paddingHorizontal: `7.5rs`,
  },
  //...
});
```

## useRStyle

A hook is provided for [createRStyle](#createrstyle) to create a dynamic responsive scale. This hook generates a new style when there are changes in dimensions, the parsing method, type, or bases. It accepts tree arguments:

1. The first argument is the style and is required
2. The second argument is the dependency list to regenerate styles after changing them, and default is an empty array
3. The third argument is the parsing method which is optional and the default is `recursive`

An example:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { FRProvider, useRStyle } from 'react-native-full-responsive';

const SIZE = 20;

const ResponsiveBox: React.FC = () => {
  const styles = useRStyle({
    container: {
      flex: 1,
      alignItems: 'center',
      justifyContent: 'center',
    },
    box: {
      height: `${SIZE * 3}rs`,
      justifyContent: 'center',
      backgroundColor: 'yellow',
      marginVertical: `${SIZE}rs`,
      paddingHorizontal: `${SIZE / 2}rs`,
    },
    textBold: {
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      fontSize: `${SIZE}rs`,
    },
  }, [], 'recursive');

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.box}>
        <Text style={styles.textBold}>My awesome responsive text!</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <FRProvider type="sm">
      <ResponsiveBox />
    </FRProvider>
  );
}
```

## responsiveScale (rs)

This function scales the passed size based on the user's device dimensions and base width size and returns the scaled value. It accepts the following arguments:

1. Required argument: The size to be scaled.
2. Optional argument (for event listeners): The screen width.

3. Optional argument (for event listeners): The screen height.

4. Optional argument (for specifying current `type` and custom `bases`)

The second and third arguments are only needed when adding an event listener to respond to dimension changes (e.g., switching between portrait and landscape modes) and forth arguments to specify current `type` and custom `bases`.

In function components, you can use the [useResponsiveScale](#useResponsiveScale) or [useResponsiveMethods](#useResponsiveMethods) hooks for a more streamlined approach. It only requires passing the size to be scaled, eliminating the need for additional steps or arguments.

```tsx
import { rs } from 'react-native-full-responsive';
//...
const MyComponent = () => {
  //...
  return <Text style={{ fontSize: rs(16) }}>My Scaled Text!</Text>;
};
```

## responsiveWidth (rw)

This method calculates a responsive value based on a numeric percentage value, utilizing `PixelRatio` and the provided width size. Its usage is similar to [responsiveScale](#responsivescale-rs), but it differs in that it only takes two arguments:

1. Required argument: A numeric **percentage** value.

2. Optional argument: A custom screen width for width calculations.

```tsx
import { rw } from 'react-native-full-responsive';
//...
const MyComponent = () => {
  //...
  return (
    <View style={{ width: rw(5) }}>
      {
        //...
      }
    </View>
  );
};
```

## responsiveHeight (rh)

This method calculates a responsive value based on a numeric percentage value, utilizing `PixelRatio` and the provided height size. Its usage is similar to [responsiveScale](#responsivescale-rs), but it differs in that it only takes two arguments:

1. Required argument: A numeric **percentage** value.

2. Optional argument: A custom screen height for height calculations.

```tsx
import { rh } from 'react-native-full-responsive';
//...
const MyComponent = () => {
  //...
  return (
    <View style={{ height: rh(10) }}>
      {
        //...
      }
    </View>
  );
};
```

## useResponsiveMethods (useRM)

This hook provides `rs`, `rw`, and `rh` methods, which simplify usage by only requiring the needed size to be passed. It automatically detects dimension changes, including landscape/portrait mode switches and `type` updates for scaling sizes on the provider, ensuring responsiveness without manual intervention.

```tsx
import { useResponsiveMethods } from 'react-native-full-responsive';
//...
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { rs, rw, rh } = useResponsiveMethods(); //or useRM
  //...
  return <Text style={{ fontSize: rs(16) }}>My Scaled Text!</Text>;
};
```

## useResponsiveScale (useRS)

A hook is provided for [responsiveScale](#responsivescale-rs), which only requires passing a size for scaling.

```tsx
import { useResponsiveScale } from 'react-native-full-responsive';
//...
const MyComponent = () => {
  const fontSize = useResponsiveScale(16);
  //...
  return <Text style={{ fontSize }}>My Scaled Text!</Text>;
};
```

## useResponsiveWidth (useRW)

A hook is provided for [responsiveWidth](#responsivewidth-rw), which only requires passing a percentage size.

```tsx
import { useResponsiveWidth } from 'react-native-full-responsive';
//...
const MyComponent = () => {
  const width = useResponsiveWidth(5);
  //...
  return (
    <View style={{ width }}>
      {
        //...
      }
    </View>
  );
};
```

## useResponsiveHeight (useRH)

A hook is provided for [responsiveHeight](#responsivewheight-rh), which only requires passing a percentage size.

```tsx
import { useResponsiveHeight } from 'react-native-full-responsive';
//...
const MyComponent = () => {
  const height = useResponsiveHeight(10);
  //...
  return (
    <View style={{ height }}>
      {
        //...
      }
    </View>
  );
};
```

## useResponsiveDim (useRD)

A hook is provided responsive width and height together and could to use it like below:

```tsx
import { useResponsiveDim } from 'react-native-full-responsive';
//...
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { width, height } = useResponsiveDim(10);
  //...
  return (
    <View style={{ width, height }}>
      {
        //...
      }
    </View>
  );
};
```

## useMediaQuery (useMQ)

A hook is provided to retrieve the `type` of dimension size (`xs` | `sm` | `md` | `lg` | `xl` | `2xl`) based on specified thresholds. These thresholds can be overridden either entirely or selectively for specific dimensions. This hook offers benefits for use within the provider or when actions need to be performed based on type specifications.

_Default_:

```ts
{
  'xs': 320,
  'sm': 576,
  'md': 768,
  'lg': 992,
  'xl': 1200,
  '2xl': 1440,
}
```

```tsx
import { FRProvider, useMediaQuery } from 'react-native-full-responsive';
//...

const customThresholds = {
  //...
};

export default function App() {
  const type = useMediaQuery(customThresholds);

  return (
    <FRProvider type={type}>
      {
        //...
      }
    </FRProvider>
  );
}
```

## HOC

If you use class components, it's all under control! You can access `rs`, `rw`, and `rh` functions using the `withResponsiveMethods` (or withRM) HOC. For media query, use the `withMediaQuery` (or withMQ) HOC. For detailed guidance on employing these HOCs within your class components, kindly refer to [the class app examples](./example/src/ClassApp/).
